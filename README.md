OUTPUT 

**In this task, I developed a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main aim of this website is to present my personal information, educational background, technical skills, and project details in a simple and attractive way. A portfolio website is very useful for students because it helps in showing our knowledge and abilities to others in an organized manner.

The structure of the website is created using HTML. HTML is used to design the basic layout of the webpage. It helps in arranging content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and sections. Different sections like Home, About Me, Skills, and Projects are created to make the website easy to navigate. HTML acts as the foundation of the website and ensures that the content is displayed correctly in the browser.

CSS is used to style the website and make it visually appealing. With the help of CSS, colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts are applied to the website. A modern and clean design is created so that users can easily read and understand the content. CSS also helps in making the website responsive, which means the website can be viewed properly on different screen sizes such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.

JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It helps in controlling animations and improving user experience. In this project, the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library is used along with JavaScript to create smooth animations. GSAP helps in adding motion effects to text, headings, and sections when the page loads. These animations make the website more engaging and professional looking.

The website is developed using separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach makes the code clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain. It also helps in understanding how different technologies work together in web development. The project can be run directly in a web browser using Visual Studio Code without using any command line tools or additional software.

This task helped me understand the basics of front-end web development. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML, design it using CSS, and add simple animations using JavaScript and GSAP. I also gained knowledge about how animations can improve the overall look and feel of a website.

Overall, this personal portfolio website project improved my practical skills and confidence in web development. It can be used as a personal online profile for internships, job applications, and academic purposes. This task helped me apply theoretical knowledge into a real-time project and understand how professional websites are created.
